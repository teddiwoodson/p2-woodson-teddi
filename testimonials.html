                  The training is top notch, instructors are passionate and squared away, the facility is immaculate and most importantly, you’re going to leave with a new best friend that will not judge you

            <p>“Through the years I have worked hard, acknowledging my triggers and applying my coping skills.  However, I needed help overcoming some fears and obstacles. I needed this program to become human again. For years I told myself ‘sometimes you have to fail before you can fly.’ Because of K9s For Warriors, I no longer have to fly alone.”</p>

            <p>“I was a prisoner in my own life. I wanted a service dog to give me the chance to get out and feel safe, thus relieving my social anxieties and overcome my fear of crowds. K9s For Warriors provides a service member with the freedom to experience life and participate/integrate back into civilian life. It gives the warrior hope to push forward.”</p>

            <p>“K9s gave me back my confidence, and most importantly, my smile. It’s given me a reason to get out of bed excited about facing my fears and challenging myself. I know my Service Dog will be there for me to lean on. I lacked that security before I came to Camp K9. It’s given me a reason to be grateful, instead of carrying around my usual grudge. It gives you a purpose and a responsibility, and of course, a battle buddy.”</p>

            <p>“In a way, both Tycho and I had some demons and baggage in our previous life. We came to each other with no preconceptions and were just there for each other. I was skeptical about the good that this would have, but as the bonding process went on we got reliant on each other, him not just for life-sustaining food and water and me not just a companion, but as one hot mess that matched perfectly and made us both feel better. I want to thank everyone at K9s for they love they put forth to us. You would think they are making millions doing their job. If it’s measured in lives, they are.”</p>
