I had some issues when trying to consolidate my "read more" code. I ended up just using individual functions for each of those pages. I also did not figure out how to make my accordion close, but I felt that it still managed to be user friendly

The only outside resource I used was this stack overflow article: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22493727/creating-a-read-more-link-that-extends-the-content-on-the-page
